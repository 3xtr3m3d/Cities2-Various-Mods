## Notice

Currently, the mod only supports three-way and four-way junctions. Any other types of junctions will behave like those in the vanilla game, except that pedestrians will always have an exclusive phase.

## How To Use

1. Open the Roads Tool, switch to the Road Services tab, and select "Traffic Lights"

2. A small window should appear in the top-left corner of your screen

3. Select the signal mode you prefer

4. Move your cursor to any existing junction and press the left mouse button, just like how you activate traffic lights within the game

5. The selected traffic lights system should now operate in your chosen mode
